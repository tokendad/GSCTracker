## [2.0.1] - 2026-02-07

### Major Infrastructure Upgrade: PostgreSQL Migration

This release completes the migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys, significantly improving scalability, concurrent user support, and production readiness.

### Added

**Database Migration to PostgreSQL:**
- Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL 16 with full UUID support
- Implemented UUID v4 primary keys across all 19 database tables
- Created comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with proper constraints and indexes
- Added connection pooling with pg-pool (configurable pool size 2-10 connections)
- Implemented query helper utilities for abstraction layer
- Added slow query detection and logging (>1000ms threshold)

**Session Storage Migration:**
- Migrated session storage from SQLite to Redis 7
- Implemented automatic session TTL management via Redis
- Added Redis connection error handling and automatic reconnection
- Removed manual session cleanup (Redis handles TTL automatically)

**Code Modernization:**
- Converted all 200+ database queries from synchronous to asynchronous (async/await)
- Updated all 54 API route handlers to async pattern
- Converted Passport authentication strategies to async
- Implemented proper transaction handling with PostgreSQL pattern
- Added comprehensive error handling for all database operations

**Documentation:**
- Created PostgreSQL migration guides and conversion summaries
- Updated all phase documentation with PostgreSQL status
- Added database connection troubleshooting guides
- Created .env.example with PostgreSQL and Redis configuration

### Changed

**Database Architecture:**
- SQLite (synchronous) → PostgreSQL 16 (asynchronous)
- Integer auto-increment IDs → UUID v4 primary keys
- Boolean representation: `0/1` → `true/false`
- Timestamp functions: `datetime('now')` → `NOW()`
- Query placeholders: `?` → `$1, $2, $3...` (PostgreSQL style)
- Column naming: Added quotes for camelCase columns (e.g., `"userId"`, `"firstName"`)

**Session Management:**
- Session store: SQLiteStore → RedisStore
- Session backend: connect-sqlite3 → connect-redis
- TTL management: Manual cleanup → Automatic Redis expiration

**Query Pattern:**
- Synchronous prepared statements → Asynchronous parameterized queries
- `db.prepare().get()` → `await db.getOne()`
- `db.prepare().all()` → `await db.getAll()`
- `db.prepare().run()` → `await db.run()`
- `db.transaction()` → `await db.transaction(async (client) => {...})`

**Dependencies:**
- Added: `pg` (^8.11.3), `pg-pool` (^3.6.1), `redis` (^4.6.12), `connect-redis` (^7.1.0), `uuid` (^9.0.1), `dotenv` (^17.2.4)
- Retained (for backward compatibility): `better-sqlite3`, `connect-sqlite3`

### Infrastructure

**Docker Services:**
- PostgreSQL 16 Alpine with health checks and volume persistence
- Redis 7 Alpine with health checks and data volumes
- Docker Compose configuration for development environment

**Environment Configuration:**
- Added PostgreSQL connection settings (host, port, database, user, password, SSL, pool config)
- Added Redis connection settings (host, port, password, database)
- Implemented dotenv for environment variable management

### Performance

- Connection pooling enables efficient concurrent user support
- Asynchronous queries prevent blocking operations
- Redis session storage provides sub-millisecond session access
- PostgreSQL query optimizer for complex JOIN operations
- Prepared statement caching via pg-pool

### Migration Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL schema creation with UUIDs (19 tables)
- ✅ Redis session storage implementation
- ✅ All 200+ query conversions to async/await
- ✅ Passport strategy updates
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Development environment setup
- ✅ Admin user creation
- ✅ Full endpoint testing

**Verified Working:**
- ✅ Authentication (login, logout, session persistence)
- ✅ User profile management
- ✅ Sales CRUD operations
- ✅ Donations CRUD operations
- ✅ Events CRUD operations
- ✅ Payment methods management
- ✅ All troop management endpoints
- ✅ Cookie catalog and seasons
- ✅ Invitation system
- ✅ Bulk imports and exports

### Technical Details

**Schema Enhancements:**
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE and SET NULL actions
- CHECK constraints for enum-like fields
- Comprehensive indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Unique constraints on natural keys (email, googleId, token)
- Proper NULL handling and default values

**Security Improvements:**
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Connection pooling with connection limits
- Redis password support for production
- SSL support for PostgreSQL connections
- Audit logging with UUID tracking

### Breaking Changes

**For Developers:**
- All database access must now be asynchronous (requires `await`)
- Column names with camelCase must be quoted in SQL queries
- Transaction syntax changed to PostgreSQL pattern
- Integer IDs replaced with UUID strings
- Boolean values are now `true/false` instead of `0/1`

**For Deployment:**
- Requires PostgreSQL 14+ and Redis 6+ servers
- New environment variables required (see .env.example)
- Database must be initialized with migration scripts
- Docker Compose recommended for local development

### Notes

This is a major infrastructure upgrade that significantly improves the application's ability to scale to multiple concurrent users. The migration to PostgreSQL with UUIDs provides enterprise-grade reliability and prepares the application for production deployment.

All existing functionality has been preserved with 100% feature parity. The asynchronous architecture improves responsiveness under load.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-02

### Major Release: Multi-User Authentication & Troop Management Foundation

This major release transforms Apex Scout Manager from a single-user application into a comprehensive multi-user troop management platform with enterprise-grade security.

### Added

**Authentication & Security:**
- Multi-user authentication system with email/password and Google OAuth 2.0 support
- Session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies and IP tracking
- Password hashing with bcryptjs (12 salt rounds)
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- COPPA compliance features for minors (age verification, parental consent tracking)
- Audit logging system for all user actions

**User Management:**
- User registration and login system
- User roles: Scout, Parent, Troop Leader, Council Admin
