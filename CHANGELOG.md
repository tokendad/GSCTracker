### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed
- Fix YAML syntax errors in changelog workflow ([#17](https://github.com/tokendad/GSCTracker/pull/17))
  - Resolved issues from 21 consecutive failed workflow runs between PR #7 (which created the workflow) and PR #17
  - Fixed YAML parsing errors: changed `'on':` to `on:` and corrected heredoc indentation in multiline script
  - All 21 failures showed 0 jobs executed due to GitHub Actions being unable to parse the workflow file
  - Root cause: Heredoc content at column 0 while surrounding bash script was indented to column 10, causing YAML parser to fail with "could not find expected ':'"
  - Solution: Indented heredoc content to maintain YAML validity and added `sed` command to normalize output file
